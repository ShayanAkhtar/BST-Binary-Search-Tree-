# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This repository contains a C++ program that implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The program allows users to perform various operations on the BST, including insertion, deletion, searching for a value, finding the maximum and minimum values, and displaying the tree in different traversal orders (pre-order, in-order, post-order).

## Program Overview

The program utilizes a `node` class to represent individual nodes in the BST. Each node contains an integer value, along with pointers to its left and right child nodes. The `BST` class encapsulates the functionalities of the binary search tree.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled program.
4. Choose from the available options in the menu to perform operations on the BST.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input values or perform specific actions.

## Functionality

The program offers the following operations on the binary search tree:

- Insertion: Add a new value to the tree.
- Deletion: Remove a value from the tree.
- Searching: Find if a value exists in the tree.
- Maximum Value: Find the maximum value in the tree.
- Minimum Value: Find the minimum value in the tree.
- Display: Print the tree in pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal orders.
